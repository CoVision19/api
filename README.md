# CoVision19 API

## Installation

To be able to run this API on your computer, you will need:
- To install Node.JS
- To install Yarn (a package manager for Node.JS)
- Clone this repository
- Get inside the repository folder
- Execute ```yarn install```
- Execute ```yarn global add nodemon``` (you might root rights!)

## Running the API

If everything has been done right, then you are ready to execute the API locally.
If you want to run the API with a file watcher that will auto-restart the web server when a change is made, use ```yarn dev```.
If you want a production like web server, use ```yarn start```.

For now the default port is `3000`, therefore to test that the API is running just go to `http://localhost:3000`.
